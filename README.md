# Advent of Code Environment

Welcome to your personalized development environment for solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles! This project is designed to streamline your workflow, automate tedious tasks, and let you focus on what's fun: the problem-solving.

It provides a robust command-line interface (CLI) and a Python module to handle everything from fetching puzzle data and submitting answers to archiving your solutions and viewing your progress over the years.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Interactive Setup**: A one-time `aoc setup` wizard to securely configure your session cookie and preferences.
* **Solution Management**: Automatically or manually archive your code with `aoc.bind()` and load it back into your workspace with `aoc load`.
* **Boilerplate Generation**: Kickstart new puzzles instantly with the `aoc start` command.
* **Custom Templates**: Save and load your own boilerplate templates for different kinds of puzzles.
* **Automatic Git Commits**: Optionally auto-commit your solutions with a standardized message upon successful binding.
* **Full CLI Control**: Manage your entire workflow from the terminal with intuitive commands.
* **Stats Viewer**: Get a beautiful, overview of your progress across all years with `aoc stats`.
* **Local Caching**: All puzzle inputs, texts, answers, and submissions are cached locally. This makes the tool incredibly fast and respects the AoC servers by minimizing requests.
* **Safe & Robust**: Built-in safety checks, confirmation prompts for destructive actions.
* **Helpful Logging**: Use the `-v` flag to see what the tool is doing behind the scenes.

## üöÄ Getting Started

There are two ways to use this project: as a user solving puzzles or as a contributor improving the tool.

### As a User (Recommended)

This is the standard way to use the project for your own Advent of Code solutions. You will create your own personal fork of this repository.

1.  **Fork the Repository**: On the GitHub page for this repository, click the **"Fork"** button in the top-right corner. This will create a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.

2.  **Clone Your Fork**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/aoc-env.git
    cd aoc-env
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment**: Create a virtual environment and install the project and its dependencies. `uv` is recommended for its speed, but `pip` and `venv` work perfectly well.

    **Recommended (`uv`):**
    ```bash
    # Create and activate a virtual environment using uv
    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # Install the project
    uv pip install -e .
    ```

    **Alternative (`pip` and `venv`):**
    ```bash
    # Create a virtual environment using Python's built-in venv
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # Install the project using pip
    pip install -e .
    ```

4.  **Configure Your Session**: Run the one-time setup wizard to configure your Advent of Code session cookie and user preferences.
    ```bash
    aoc setup
    ```

5.  **Sync Your Progress**: Run the `sync` command to fetch your puzzle completion history (stars) from the Advent of Code website.
    ```bash
    aoc sync
    ```

You are now ready to start solving puzzles! All your solutions and progress will be saved to your own personal repository.

### As a Contributor

If you want to contribute to improving the `aoc-env` tool itself, please see the guidelines in the `COLLABORATING.md` file.

## üîß Workflow

Here is the typical workflow for solving a puzzle from start to finish.

### 1. Set Your Context

Before you begin, tell the environment which puzzle you want to work on. This context is saved and will be used by all subsequent commands.

```bash
# Set the context to December 1st, 2024
aoc context set --year 2024 --day 1

# You can check the current context anytime
aoc context show
```

### 2. Start a New Puzzle

Generate a fresh template in your workspace. This populates `notepad.py` with a useful starting structure.

```bash
aoc start
```

### 3. Get Oriented

Read the puzzle text and check the input format directly from your terminal. These commands automatically use the context you set in step 1.

```bash
# Get the puzzle description for the current context
aoc text

# Get the raw puzzle input for the current context
aoc input
```

### 4. Write Your Solution

Open `notepad.py` in your favorite editor.
- The context is already set, so `aoc.get_input()` will fetch the correct data.
- Write your code and assign your final calculation to the `answer` variable.

### 5. Run and Test

Execute your code using the `run` command. Use the `-t` flag to time its execution.

```bash
aoc run -t
```

### 6. Submit and Archive

Once you have an answer, uncomment the `print(aoc.submit(answer, part=...))` line in `notepad.py`, specify the correct part number (1 or 2), and run your code again.

```bash
aoc run
```

If your answer is correct, your solution will be automatically bound (if you enabled it during setup). If not, you can add `aoc.bind(part=1)` to the end of your script and run it one last time to save it.

### 7. Start Part 2

To start the next part, you can clear your workspace with `aoc clear` or load your Part 1 solution back into the notepad to modify it.

```bash
# Load your Part 1 solution for the current context into notepad.py
aoc load 1
```

## üíæ Custom Templates

You can save the contents of `notepad.py` as a named template to reuse later. This is great for setting up common scenarios, like graph traversal or grid manipulation problems. The environment comes with a standard `default` template, which you can customize to your liking by running `aoc template save default --force`. All templates are stored in the `.templates/` directory.

* **Save a template:** `aoc template save <template_name> [-f]`
* **List all templates:** `aoc template list`
* **Load a template:** `aoc template load <template_name> [-f]`
* **Delete a template:** `aoc template delete <template_name>`

## üß© Puzzle Solver's Toolkit (`aoc.tools`)

To accelerate development, this environment includes a built-in toolkit of helpers for common Advent of Code patterns. You can import these tools in your `notepad.py` script like so:
`from aoc import tools`

**Key features include:**
* **`tools.Grid`**: A powerful class for working with 2D grids, featuring easy neighbor-finding and coordinate-based access.
* **Graph Algorithms**: Standard implementations of `tools.bfs`, `tools.dfs`, and `tools.dijkstra` for pathfinding and graph traversal.
* **Geometry & Interval Helpers**: Functions like `tools.manhattan_distance`, `tools.bresenham_line`, `tools.shoelace_area`, and `tools.merge_intervals` for specific puzzle archetypes.
* **Performance**: A `@tools.memoize` decorator to automatically cache the results of expensive, recursive functions.
* **And more**: The toolkit also includes helpers for tree structures and advanced number theory.

## üß™ Test Case Management

The `test` command group allows you to manage local test cases for each puzzle. Instead of relying on a fragile scraper, you can manually add the examples from the puzzle description once. This gives you a reliable set of tests to run your code against while you develop. Test cases are stored in `.cache/<year>/<day>/tests.json`.

* **Add a test interactively:** `aoc test add`
* **List saved tests:** `aoc test list`
* **Delete a test:** `aoc test delete <part> <index>`
* **Run tests:** `aoc test run`

## üí° Future Ideas

### Automated Testing Framework

The next major feature planned for this environment is a full **Automated Testing Framework**. An `aoc test` command will automatically extract examples from puzzle descriptions and run your code against them, providing instant feedback on your logic.
