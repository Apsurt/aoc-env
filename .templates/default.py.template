# --- Context Setting ---
# The puzzle context (year and day) is now set globally via the CLI.
# Use 'aoc context set -y <year> -d <day>' to set it.
# Use 'aoc context show' to see the current setting.


# --- Puzzle Logic ---
# Get the puzzle input. The 'get_input' function will automatically
# use the context that has been set.
puzzle_input = aoc.get_input()

# Your solution logic here...
def your_function_name():
    return

answer = your_function_name()

# --- Submission ---
# After solving, uncomment the following line and specify the part
# number (1 or 2) to submit your answer.

# if answer is not None:
#     print(aoc.submit(answer, part=1))

# --- Binding ---
# To save your solution, you can use aoc.bind(part=1)
# aoc.bind(part=1)
